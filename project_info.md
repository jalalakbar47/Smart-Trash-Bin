# 📘 Project Info: Smart Trash Bin System

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a smart, contactless trash bin using low-cost components.
- Utilize distance sensing to automatically open and close the lid.
- Promote hygienic waste disposal in public and private spaces.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

- An **ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)** detects when a person comes near.
- If the person is detected within a set distance, a **servo motor** opens the lid.
- The system waits a few seconds and then automatically closes the lid.

## 💡 Real-world Applications

- Smart homes and offices
- Hospitals and clinics for hygienic waste disposal
- Public places like airports, malls, and schools
- Contactless automation during pandemic situations

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Interfacing **ultrasonic sensors** and **servo motors** with microcontrollers
- Writing clean Python code for IoT applications
- Creating **GitHub project structure**, documentation, and diagram integration
- Basics of automation and hygienic system design
